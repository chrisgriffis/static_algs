# static_algs
a place to put some "keeper" examples of template metaprogramming examples. 

the whole build.sh and sln setup has been broken by recent cleanups. the examples are all standalone and the project build just makes a silly command line interface to pick which example you want to run. a good place to try these out is https://wandbox.org, which is a very cool web ide for trying outthe most recent compiler implementations for the very lastest modern cpp support

note: these examples have been created at varying stages in my progression through using c++ as a functional programming language. there are many imprefections. this isnt meant to be a reference, merely a place to keep my cool but ugly toys.
