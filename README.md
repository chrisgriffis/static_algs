this repo is a place where I put some "keeper" examples of modern c++ template metaprogramming examples; template metaprogramming (TMP) is an endeavor in functional programming that uses the turing complete cpp type system as a turing machine to make the compiler do work for you that would otherwise occur during runtime. (at least thats what i think TMP really is).


Every example here is original work except where noted in opening license comments. Original means i wrote it myself, but in some cases like the sudoku solver are riffs on any one of the many examples in leetcode interview study guides. the whole build.sh and sln setup has been broken by recent cleanups. the examples are all standalone and the project build just makes a silly command line interface to pick which example you want to run. a good place to try these out is https://wandbox.org, which is a very cool web ide for trying outthe most recent compiler implementations for the very lastest modern cpp support

note: these examples have been created at varying stages in my progression through using c++ as a functional programming language. there are many imprefections. this isnt meant to be a reference, merely a place to keep my cool but ugly toys.
